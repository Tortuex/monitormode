# monitormode
Quick bash script to allow you to enable monitor mode + kill NetworkManager processes  &amp; disable monitor mode + restart NetworkManager processes on the given interface.
It saved me a lot of time and I thought I might as well share it with the internet, as I'm sure there are a lot of other lazy people out there like me! ;)

# instructions
To download the script, type `git clone https://www.github.com/Tortuex/monitormode.git` then `cd monitormode`, `chmod +x monitorMode.sh` and finally `./monitorMode.sh` to execute the script!
